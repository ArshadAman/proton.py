Here comes my next Python project, after long time and a small break from front-end development.

The Zeb-Sat is a Python IDE.

 you can open your files. you can save your files. you can execute your commands.
 
But don't forget to save your commands before executing it.

Try writing your Python codes on Zeb-Sat.
